# General

This repository contains various docker files which provides a IDE like experience for nvim using the great plugin ecosystem.
To see more details about the used nvim plugins and configs please check the init.vim files in their associated folders.
The configuration is based on personal preferences and relies heavyly on the [coc.nvim plugin](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim)

Each folder contains a README.md file with further setup instructions. Besides building and running the docker container
it is initially required to install dependencies within the container. Therefore please pay attention on the various README.
