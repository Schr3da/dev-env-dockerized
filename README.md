# General

This repository contains various docker files which provide an IDE like experience in different containers. It is possible to use them locally or on a remote server. 
The tools are separated into a command line approach based on vim/nvim and and browser based approach using e.g. code-server. 
More configurations may follow. 

In addition the configurations are tested by considering remote access using mobile devices. Therefore the browser tools are tested using mobile OS specific browsers 
e.g Safari on iPadOS. 

The goal is to provide an simple to use containerised ide like environments which can be hosted on a remote server and accessed by any device.

Each folder contains a README.md file with further setup instructions. Besides building and running the docker container
it is initially required to install dependencies within the container. Therefore please pay attention on the various README.
